## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
We're a group of people from around the globe, based in Canda.
<br><br>
Our project is the Prometheus mSLA printer, a resin printer that aims to be fully open-source.
This consists of:
- The [CAD](https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/Prometheus-MSLA)
- The [Apollo Controller Board](https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/Apollo)
- The [Custom OS](https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/PrometheusOS)
- The Backend, [Odyssey](https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/Odyssey)
- The Frontend (WIP)

We try to aim to stay as true to open-source as possible! As this is a WIP effort,
not all Licenses might be abiding by the requirements at all times.
